    1. **Extract Keywords:**
       - Extract the most important **skills, qualifications, technologies, certifications**, and other relevant details (like **years of experience**) from both texts.
       - For example: skills like "Java", "Spring Boot", "AWS", and qualifications like "3+ years of experience."
    
    2. **Match Keywords:**
       - Compare the keywords from the job description with those from the candidate's resume.
       - Count how many keywords from the **job description** appear in the **candidateâ€™s resume**. Make sure the comparison includes exact skills, qualifications, and technologies.
    
    3. **Calculate Match Percentage:**
       - Use this formula to calculate the match percentage:
         \`(matched_keywords / total_job_description_keywords) * 100\`.
       - Show the exact formula used, and return the percentage with **two decimal places**.
    
    4. **Provide a Summary:**
       - Give a brief summary explaining the main **matches** and **differences** between the job description and the resume.
       - Mention any missing qualifications or additional qualifications the candidate has.
    
    Return the response in this exact JSON format:
    {
      "job_description_keywords": ["list of keywords from the job description"],
      "resume_keywords": ["list of keywords from the candidate's resume"],
      "matched_keywords": ["list of matching keywords"],
      "match_percentage": "calculated percentage",
      "summary": "A brief summary of the comparison"
    }
    
    Here are the texts:
    
    **Job Description:** 
    ${data.description}
    
    **Candidate's Resume:** 
    ${cvText}
    
    Follow the steps above exactly and return the response in the specified JSON format. Ensure that the match percentage is accurate and reflects the degree of similarity between the two texts.
